Once they have trained and validated the model, they typically then hand off productionization of the model to **_Machine Learning Engineers_**. Whereas the Data Scientist creates the basic prototype, the Machine Learning Engineer's job is to put that model into a production system in a performant and maintainable manner. Whereas Data Scientists at large companies focus on the \"big picture\" by finding solutions to business problems, Machine Learning Engineers focus on the details, implementing the solutions created by the Data Scientists in the best way possible. Data Scientists focus more on analytics and statistics, whereas Machine Learning Engineers will have a stronger command of backend engineering, data structures and algorithms, and software engineering overall.

In some companies, it means a data analyst or a DBA focused on databases or data pipelines. In others, it means someone with a scientific mindset skilled with running A/B tests. Yet others may be highly specialized machine learning roles in areas like NLP, Computer Vision, or Deep Learning -- and these roles may break down further into specializations focused on either research or implementation. As a Junior Data Scientist entering the workforce, it's most likely that you'll land in a generalist role, spending the first few years of your career working on various tasks that focus on all of these areas at least a little bit. Specialization happens later in your career. Out of the gate, the best thing that you can be is a **strong generalist**, with the demonstrated ability to contribute to many different sorts of projects that might be expected of a Data Science team.\n", "\n", "### Being a 'Scrappy' Data Scientist\n", "\n", "Large companies with official Machine Learning Engineer roles are typically only looking for more-advanced candidates.
